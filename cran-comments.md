We expect 60 reverse dependency failures, listed below. We have sent each of
these a pull request containing a backwards compatible patch. See
https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/6262 for more information.

All reverse dependency failures have had over a month to update their package,
with the exception of autoGO and injurytools, which are new packages that made
it to CRAN in January after we notified all other maintainers.
